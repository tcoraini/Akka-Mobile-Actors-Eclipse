   * Our UUID will be generated in a similar way of AspectWerkz, using the System.currentTimeMillis.
   * But we're gonna add the identification of the node where the ID was generated, preventing that
   * equal UUID's are generated at exactly the same time in different machines.
   *
   * The currentTimeMillis uses 41 bits (for the next 28 years), so we shift the node ID 41 bits to the
   * left. This way, the final UUID will be of the form 1NNN..NNNTTT..TTT, where:
   *  - 1 -> always the first bit, so the resulting UUID is a positive Long
   *  - NNN..NNN -> the bits for the node ID. It can take from 1 to 22 bits. We are just assuming there will
   *  be no more than 4194304 nodes (the largest number we can write with 22 bits).
   *  - TTT..TTT -> the bits for the timestamp (System.currentTimeMillis). Uses 41 bits for the next 28 years.
